Restaurant Reviews_
## Project Overview: Stage 1
For the Restaurant Reviews projects, I was tasked to incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In Stage One, I had to take a static design that lacked accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I was also tasked to begin converting this to a Progressive Web Application by caching some assets for offline use.

### Specification
I was provided code for a restaurant reviews website. The code had a lot of issues. It was barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device. It also didn’t include any of the standard accessibility features, and it didn’t work offline at all. I had to update this code to resolve these issues while still maintaining the included functionality.

## Leaflet.js and Mapbox:

This repository uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). You need to replace `<your MAPBOX API KEY HERE>` with a token from [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). Mapbox is free to use, and does not require any payment information.

### Note about ES6

Most of the code in this project has been written to the ES6 JavaScript specification for compatibility with modern web browsers and future-proofing JavaScript code. As much as possible, try to maintain use of ES6 in any additional JavaScript you write.
